[nio-9090-exec-2] org.hibernate.AssertionFailure :
HHH000099: an assertion failure occurred
(this may indicate a bug in Hibernate, but is more likely due to unsafe use of the session):
org.hibernate.AssertionFailure: null id in com.luka.gamesellerrating.entity.AuthorizedRating entry (don't flush the Session after an exception occurs)

comment: in application, there are 2 types of rating - authorized and unauthorized.
anonymous and authorized users can rate the seller profile
while saving the rating, if the user is authorized, error occurs and comment is saved with many duplicates

solution: removed cascade All from the comment in rating entity and managed comment manually
